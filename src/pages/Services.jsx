//         If you’re thinking of starting a blog of your own, but just don’t have a
//         clue on what to blog about, then fear not! In this article, I have
//         included a whole load of blog examples from a wide variety of different
//         niches, all run on different blogging platforms like WordPress, Joomla!
//         and Drupal. Since the beginning of the internet, millions and millions
//         and millions of blogs have been created. Many have died due to lost
//         interest or their owners giving up on the idea, while others have
//         thrived and continue to grow, making money and earning their owners a
//         steady income. It’s a constant evolution of content that keeps people
//         coming back for more, especially if these blogs contact highly
//         resourceful material that people find useful and interesting. Each
//         example listed in this blog post are all different in some way and all
//         bring something unique to their readers & subscribers. I want to show
//         you what is possible and how you can take inspiration from them and
//         create an awesome blog of your own. Some of these blogs make over $100k
//         a month, others are just a hobby for their owners, but all have the same
//         purpose at their core… the love of writing and sharing information. Some
